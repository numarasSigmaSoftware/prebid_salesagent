"""ProtocolWebhookEnv — integration test environment for ProtocolWebhookService.

Real: a local HTTP origin that actually serves the POST, the real database for
      the ``webhook_delivery_log`` rows the service writes, and a real
      ``ProtocolWebhookService`` instance.
Mocked: nothing. There is no ``EXTERNAL_PATCHES`` entry on purpose — the whole
      point of this env is that the transport is not substituted: the assertions
      grade ``src.core.security.outbound_http.asend`` putting real bytes on a
      real socket, indifferent to how the seam is implemented.

Why an env rather than the bare ``local_origin`` fixture plus direct calls:
``ProtocolWebhookService`` writes its delivery log through
``DeliveryRepository``, whose rows carry a foreign key to ``media_buys``, and
the ``PushNotificationConfig`` it is handed is an ORM instance.
``IntegrationEnv.__enter__`` is what binds the factory session, so outside an
env neither row can be created at all.

``LocalOriginMixin`` already means "start the origin, publish ``webhook_url``,
open both outbound escape hatches" — the origin necessarily listens on loopback
over plain HTTP, which the egress seam refuses by default. Composing it is how
that decision stays spelled once.

The ONE service instance per env (:attr:`ProtocolWebhookEnv.service`) is
load-bearing, not a convenience: the property this migration exists to create is
that a single service instance can deliver to two different hostnames, which is
only expressible if the tests share one instance across deliveries.

Requires: integration_db fixture (creates test PostgreSQL DB).

Usage::

    @pytest.mark.requires_db
    async def test_something(self, integration_db):
        with ProtocolWebhookEnv() as env:
            env.setup_default_data()
            env.set_http_status(200)

            delivered = await env.send()

            assert delivered is True
            assert env.delivery_attempts == 1
