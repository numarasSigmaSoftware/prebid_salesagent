"""Shared fixtures for driving ContextManager._send_push_notifications in tests.

Both ``test_context_manager_task_pinning`` (webhook task GC pinning) and
``test_context_manager_task_type_label`` (task_type wire/label split)
drive the REAL ``_send_push_notifications`` path. These helpers
build the step and the session mock so the two suites don't hand-roll the same
setup (DRY -- enforced by check_code_duplication).

The shape here tracks production, and production got SIMPLER: that path used to
issue three hand-written ``session.scalars()`` queries in a fixed order
(ObjectWorkflowMapping, Context, PushNotificationConfig), so the session mock was
an ordered side_effect list and any reordering of the production code silently
mis-fed it. It now reads ``step.object_mappings`` and ``step.context`` -- two
relationships that already existed on ``WorkflowStep`` -- and asks
``PushNotificationConfigRepository`` for the configs. One query, no ordering
contract.
