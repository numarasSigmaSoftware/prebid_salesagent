"""Guard: the webhook registration value HOLDS the adcp SDK config, never a copy.

Critical Pattern #1 says local types extend the adcp library type rather than
duplicating it. ``test_architecture_schema_inheritance.py`` enforces that, but
only inside ``src/core/schemas/`` — and ``ValidatedWebhookRegistration`` was
introduced in ``src/core/webhooks/``, outside that scan, as a frozen dataclass
carrying ``url`` plus two FLATTENED auth primitives.

What that cost, concretely: the pinned
``dist/schemas/3.1.1/core/push-notification-config.json`` defines four fields
(``url``, ``operation_id``, ``token``, ``authentication``) and the hand-rolled
type modelled two of them. So ``operation_id`` and ``token`` were silently
dropped at ingest — both carry echo obligations the seller MUST honour, and
``operation_id``'s is graded by the conformance universal
``dist/compliance/3.1.1/universal/webhook-emission.yaml`` requirement 1, which
also forbids recovering it by parsing the receiver URL. Once dropped at
registration it is unrecoverable.

Why this guard is NARROW rather than a general "no hand-rolled SDK parallels"
scan: a general field-overlap detector was written first and REJECTED, because
measured against this very case it scored 25% — the flattening renamed the
fields, so the duplication was invisible to field comparison — while flagging 41
mostly-coincidental hits elsewhere. A check that misses the case it exists for is
worse than none. This one asserts the specific invariant that was violated, with
no heuristic and no false positives.

The general duplication debt those 41 hits partly represent is real and
uncovered, but it is pre-existing and belongs to its own change.
