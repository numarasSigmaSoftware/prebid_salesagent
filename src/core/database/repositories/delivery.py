"""Delivery repository — tenant-scoped data access for webhook delivery tables.

Covers two ORM models:
- WebhookDeliveryRecord: webhook payload snapshots with retry tracking
- WebhookDeliveryLog: delivery report webhook sends with sequence tracking

Core invariant: every query includes tenant_id in the WHERE clause. The tenant_id
is set at construction time and injected into all queries automatically.

Write methods add objects to the session but never commit — the caller (or UoW)
handles commit/rollback at the boundary.

        Both senders conclude here. Before this existed, the only persisted
        recorder was a private fourteen-parameter method on ONE sender, reachable
        from nothing else, and it ran on failure paths only — so "did this webhook
        conclude, and how" was answerable for one sender, half the time. The other
        sender wrote nothing at all. Two senders each re-deriving the encoding is
        how a refusal came to be spelled the same as a delivery the buyer's
        endpoint actually rejected.

        The kind -> row mapping lives here, once:

        ============================  ==========  ===============================
        ``outcome.kind``              ``status``  ``attempt_count``
        ============================  ==========  ===============================
        ``delivered``                 success     ``outcome.attempts``
        ``refused_destination``       refused     ``outcome.attempts`` — always 0
        ``client_error``              failed      ``outcome.attempts``
        ``exhausted``                 failed      ``outcome.attempts``
        ``refused_auth``              *no row*    —
        ============================  ==========  ===============================

        ``attempt_count`` is the outcome's own count, never re-derived from the
        kind: a refusal arrives with ``attempts=0`` because nothing was attempted
        (``webhook_egress._outcome_for_outbound_error``), and a recorder that
        second-guessed that would be one more place the two could disagree.

        ``refused_destination`` gets its own status value rather than reusing
        ``"failed"``: a destination refused before a connection was opened is not
        a delivery that failed on the wire, and an operator who cannot tell those
        apart cannot tell a misconfigured URL from a flaky endpoint. It is a
        String column, so this is a new value and not a migration.

        ``refused_auth`` writes NOTHING, deliberately: the buyer registered an
        authentication this sender cannot produce, so no request was ever built.
        A row claiming an attempt would misreport a refusal as a delivery that
        failed on the wire. The buyer-actionable refusal already happened at
        registration time.

        Silently writes nothing when ``ctx`` is not log-eligible — that gate
        (:attr:`WebhookTaskContext.records_delivery_log`) used to be spelled once
        per branch at each sender.
