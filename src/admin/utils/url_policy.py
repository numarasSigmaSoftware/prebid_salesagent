"""Ingest-time egress policy for admin write handlers.

Admin write paths accept URLs that are STORED now and fetched later — a signals
agent endpoint, a Slack webhook, a principal's push-notification target. The
refusal an operator can act on therefore has to happen here, at ingest, long
before there is a request to attach it to. That is exactly what
:func:`src.core.security.outbound_http.validate_url` exists for: it applies the
seam's egress policy and connects to nothing, so no handler in this package
needs address policy of its own. (See the ``outbound_http`` module docstring:
this application implements no SSRF protection, ever — the policy belongs to
``adcp.signing``, reached through the one seam.)

The admin surface answers in two shapes — a form post that flashes and
redirects, and a JSON API that returns 400 — so there are two functions here
over one refusal decision. There were previously nine copies of that decision
spread across five modules, which is how a call site ends up with a policy the
others do not have.

``label`` is deliberately NOT passed to the seam as ``error.field``. The two look
alike and are not: ``label`` is an HTML form label an operator reads ("Webhook
URL"), while ``error.field`` is an AdCP JSONPath-lite path into a buyer's request
payload. Nothing on this surface builds an AdCP envelope, so there is no payload
for a path to point into, and handing a form label to that field would put a
non-AdCP namespace in it.

The message handed to the operator never interpolates the reason. The reason
names the resolved IP and distinguishes "cannot resolve" from "reserved range";
handed back to whoever supplied the URL, the pair is an internal host and port
scanner (AdCP 3.1.1, ``building/by-layer/L1/security.mdx``, point 6: do not
echo fetch errors back to the party that supplied the URL). The real reason is
not lost — ``outbound_http`` logs it at WARNING before these functions return,
and the log line below pins it to the URL and the field it came from.
